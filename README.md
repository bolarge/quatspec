# Quaspec Payment Infrastructure Project 

The project provides a RESTful API to handle request processing and also using basic controller 
entities.

The project provides a RESTful API to manage the domain entities in com.quatspec.persistence.domain package
entities.

## How to set up

For the backend an embedded H2 Database is used. Project data is initialized upon application start-up using the
*[sql/init.sql](recrt-persistence/src/main/resources/sql/init.sql)*
script present at **recrt-peristence** package.
There are 3 users pre-loaded on the initialization *init.sql* script:

username | password | email
---|---|---
user1 | 1111 | user1@smava.de
user2 | 2222 | user2@smava.de
user3 | 3333 | user3@smava.de

**user1** is the only user with **ROLE_ADMIN** so, is the only who can use some of the entry points, for example, *get users*.

## How to run it

This is a multi-layer Maven project built using **Spring framework: 5.1.0.RELEASE**.

To build the project just execute maven `mvn clean package` commands from the project root, with this you'll get a generated war file on target folder.

If you want to run the project in an embedded Tomcat instance execute `mvn tomcat7:run` command also from the project root.

## How to test it

To verify if it's correctly working you can use, for example with **curl**, read the manual using `man curl` to get details about how to use it, some examples bellow using our local running server on **http://localhost:8080**(#How-to-run-it):

##### GET request example
This example will make a **GET** request on path *rest/users*, the cookie content is gotten from a successfully login request.
```
 curl -XGET -H'Accept: application/json' -H'Content-Type: application/json' --cookie "JSESSIONID=F642BF70B000FE382DE92E5F7A024C08" -D- http://localhost:8080/rest/users
```
you'll get in your terminal something similar to this with the *status code* on the first line and the *body of the response* in the last one
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
